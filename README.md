# Bengaluru-Text-Mining

This contains both a dataset that includes over 100,000 complaints filed to the city of Bengaluru, India from 2020/02/08 - 2021/02/21, and a Python file that creates several machine learning classification models that attempts to categorize grievances automatically. 

Several of the columns of the dataset have been removed for size contraints; you can find the full data [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/bkowshik/bbmp-sahaaya).
